# 🏃‍♀️ Causal Inference: Sports and GPA Analysis

## 📄 Overview
This project investigates the causal effect of **sports participation** on **students' GPA** (Grade Point Average). Our analysis explores whether engaging in sports activities impacts academic performance, considering both potential positive effects (e.g., better mental health and cognitive function) and negative effects (e.g., reduced study time).

The study leverages methods like **propensity score matching**, **regression models**, and **random forests** to estimate treatment effects and uncover insights about this relationship.

- **Dataset**: A sample of 2,392 high school students, including demographics, study habits, and extracurricular activities from Kaggle.
- **Target**: Understanding the relationship between sports participation and GPA, while controlling for confounding variables such as parental education, study habits, and absences.

## 🛠️ Methods and Models
- **Propensity Score Matching**:
  - Ensures balanced comparisons between students who participate in sports and those who do not.
- **S-Learner and T-Learner**:
  - Evaluate the average treatment effect (ATE) and average treatment effect on the treated (ATT).
- **Random Forest & XGB Regressor**:
  - Used for robust performance comparison.
